# BudgetTracker

## Description 

Add functionality to our existing Budget Tracker application to allow for offline access and functionality.

The user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. When entering transactions offline, they should populate the total when brought back online.

## User Story 

AS AN avid traveller
I WANT to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection
SO THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling

## Usage 

To use this application, you can either clone the repo into your own editor and run npm i and then node server.js in the command line or visit the deployed application on https://dry-ridge-18037.herokuapp.com/ 

## Credits 

I worked with my tutor to bring this application to life (thank you!)
